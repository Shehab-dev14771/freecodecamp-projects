# Color Box Project

This project is part of the FreeCodeCamp CSS curriculum on colors. It demonstrates the use of various CSS color formats and styling techniques.

## Description

The webpage displays a centered heading "Color Box" with five colored boxes below it. Each box uses different CSS color formats:

- Hexadecimal (`#FF6644`)
- RGB (`rgb(17,255,177)`)
- Named color (`yellow`)
- HSL (`hsl(317,75%,50%)`)
- Gray (named color `gray`)

The boxes have rounded corners, fixed sizes, and margins for spacing. The background of the page is a light gray to highlight the colors.

## Files

- `index.html` — The HTML file containing the page structure.
- `style.css` — The external CSS file containing all the styles.

## How to Use

1. Place both `index.html` and `style.css` in the same directory.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the color boxes.
3. Modify the CSS file to experiment with colors and styles.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand different CSS color formats (hex, rgb, hsl, named colors).
- Practice CSS box styling and layout.
- Learn to link an external CSS file to an HTML document.
