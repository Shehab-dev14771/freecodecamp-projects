# Build an Event Flyer Page

This is my solution for the **"Build an Event Flyer Page"** project from [freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/).

## Project Overview

The project is a simple, responsive event flyer for the fictional **Pet Rock Festival**. It demonstrates effective use of HTML structure and modern CSS layout techniques.

## Special Focus

This project highlights the use of:

- **CSS Units**:
  - `vw` (viewport width)
  - `vh` (viewport height)
  - `auto`
  - `px`
- **CSS `calc()`** function to create flexible, responsive layouts:
  - Example: `min-height: calc(100vh - 100px);` ensures the content fills the full viewport minus header/footer spacing.

## Key Features

- Responsive layout using flexible CSS units.
- Clean design with a centered header image and sections for event information.
- External CSS file for organized styling.
- Semantic HTML with proper use of `<header>`, `<section>`, `<main>`, and `<hr>` tags.

## How to Use

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Ensure `index.html` and `style.css` are in the same folder.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (`calc()`, `vw`, `vh`, etc.)

## License

This project is part of the **Responsive Web Design Certification** on freeCodeCamp and is free to use for learning and personal practice.
