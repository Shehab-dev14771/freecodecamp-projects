## ðŸ§¾ Features & User Stories

âœ… Built to meet the following user stories:

1. Display **at least three playing cards**.
2. Contains a `<main>` element with `id="playing-cards"`.
3. Inside `#playing-cards`, there are multiple `div` elements with class `card`.
4. Each `.card` contains three child `div`s with classes:
   - `.left`
   - `.middle`
   - `.right`
5. `#playing-cards` uses **Flexbox** to:
   - Center children horizontally.
   - Allow wrapping.
   - Maintain `20px` gap between cards.
6. `.card` elements use **Flexbox** to space content using `justify-content: space-between`.
7. `.left` aligns to **start** of the card.
8. `.middle` aligns to **center** of the card and stacks symbols vertically.
9. `.right` aligns to **end** of the card and is rotated 180 degrees for symmetry.
10. Clean, gradient background and responsive card layout.
