# Multimedia Player Project

## Project Title:
**Multimedia Player with Audio, Video, and Subtitles**

## Description
This project is a basic HTML5 multimedia player that demonstrates how to use the `<audio>`, `<video>`, and `<track>` tags. It includes:
- A music player for the song "Sailing Away"
- An educational video titled "What is the map method and how does it work?"
- Subtitle support for the video using the `<track>` element
- A written transcript of the video

## Features
- Accessible multimedia playback with proper `aria-label`s
- External audio and video sources
- Subtitles through WebVTT (placeholder file used)
- Semantic HTML structure with headings and sections

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- ARIA Accessibility attributes
- WebVTT (for subtitle support)

## How to Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
2. The page will display:
   - A heading for the player
   - A section to play music
   - A video with subtitles (subtitle file must be available at `jhskjl.vtt`)
   - A transcript section for accessibility and SEO

## Note
- Make sure the subtitle file (`jhskjl.vtt`) exists in the same directory or provide the correct path.
