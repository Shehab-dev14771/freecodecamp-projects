This is a static HTML project created as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. It showcases a travel agency landing page with destination highlights, package options, and beautiful imageryâ€”all built using semantic HTML5.

## Features

## What I Learned

- Writing descriptive alt text for accessibility
